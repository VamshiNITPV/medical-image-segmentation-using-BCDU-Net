# medical-image-segmentation-using-BCDU-Net
Implemented BCDU-Net, an enhanced U-Net architecture combining Bi-directional ConvLSTM and dense convolutions for accurate lung CT image segmentation. Achieved perfect sensitivity and high AUC-ROC. The model effectively extracts contextual features, improving recall and enabling robust detection of lung regions in medical imaging.
